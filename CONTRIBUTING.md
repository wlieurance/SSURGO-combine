Anything that adds more functionality would be a welcome addition. Here are some ideas:

1. Add additional custom queries that are generally useful to a wide base of users.
2. Add conversion functionality from SpatiaLite to other geodatabase formats.
3. Add functionality to limit imports to certain Survey Areas via command line option.
4. Upgrade the sys.argv option checking to something more sophisticated like argparse.
