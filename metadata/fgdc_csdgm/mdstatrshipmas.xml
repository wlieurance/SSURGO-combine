      <abstract>The Relationship Master Static Metadata table records the metadata that pertains to a relationship, as a whole, for all relationships defined for the tabular data set. Each record in this table represents one particular relationship between two related tables. A relationship involves one or more pairs of join columns, and more than one relationship may exist between the same two tables. Information about the join columns involved in a relationship is found in the Relationship Detail Static Metadata table.</abstract>

        <attrlabl>mandatory</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>Indicates if in order for a record to exist in the right table of a relationship, a corresponding record must exist in the left table of that relationship, i.e. mandatory = "yes". In other words, when mandatory is "no", a record may exist in the right table of a relationship without having a corresponding record in the left table of that relationship.</attrdef>

      <attr>
        <attrlabl>relationshipname</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>A name given to a relationship between two tables. If there is more than one relationship between the same two tables, the name of each of those relationships must be unique.</attrdef>
      </attr>
      <attr>
        <attrlabl>cardinality</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>Indicates whether the relationship between the left table and right table is one to one (left is one, right is one) or one to many (left is one, right is many). For a one to one relationship, a record in the left table is related to no more than one record in the right table. For a one to many relationship, a record in the left table may be related to more than one record in the right table. Neither cardinality implies that a record in the left table necessarily has a corresponding record in the right table.</attrdef>
