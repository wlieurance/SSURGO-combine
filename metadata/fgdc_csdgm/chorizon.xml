      <abstract>The Horizon table lists the horizon(s) and related data for the referenced map unit component. If the horizon thickness is greater than zero (low=5, RV=8, high=12), the horizon exists everywhere this component occurs. If the horizon thickness includes zero (low=0, RV=1, high=3), the horizon may exist in some places, but not in other places. Horizons that have two distinct parts, such as E/B or E&amp;Bt horizons, are recorded twice. Once for the characteristics of the first part; and again on another row, using the same depths and thicknesses, for the characteristics of the other part.</abstract>
